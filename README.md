# Automobile-price-
Creating a model that predicts the price of the automobiles. The data consists of 25 columns and more than 200 rows of data. As a first step we load data to the jupyter notebook and performed EDA. As price is continuous variable we have used linear regression. I got R square score as 75. Then performed hyperparameter tuning and then improved R square value.
